# Json-Resume-Types

Generates Typescript types from the current version of [`resume-schema`](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema).
This will be updated whenever `resume-schema` is updated by using Dependabot to trigger the push workflow.
New versions will always match `resume-schema`'s version.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @supastuff/json-resume-types --save
```

## Usage

It's really only 1 type, but you can use
["Lookup types"](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-1.html#example-1)
to get the types of sub properties:

```ts
import ResumeSchema from '@supastuff/json-resume-types'

function doStuff(work: ResumeSchema["work"]): void { ... }
```

## Limitations

The types are generated by [`json2ts`](https://github.com/bcherny/json-schema-to-typescript)
so some of it's issues came along for the ride:

- `Iso8601` doesn't keep it's regex pattern. You'll just have to trust that where ever you use `Iso8601`, it has the correct format
- additionalProperties are defined as `[k: string]: unknown`. The unknown type may or may not cause problems for you. I think it's fine, but it sounds like there are complaints about it... [issue#356](https://github.com/bcherny/json-schema-to-typescript/issues/356), [issue#335](https://github.com/bcherny/json-schema-to-typescript/issues/335)

Also, while I'm working out some kinks, this package is only available from github packages.
